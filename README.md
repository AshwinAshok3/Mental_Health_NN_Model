# MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION
*  The data for this project is obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11/data">kaggle.com</a> where they have provided train, test, and a submission set format and data.
*  However In my case I wasn't aware of the submission format of the file therefore I have taken initiative to upload my work on github platform.
*  This dataset contains details of the academic and professional individuals details and the predictions are based on whether a person is under depression or not.
